          <h2 class="heading-secondary">4. WEBSITE IMAGES</h2>
          <p>
            Images appearing on our website are as a close a representation of our products as is possible. However colours may vary slightly, either from our suppliers, or if your computer monitor is not set up correctly.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">5. STOCK AVAILABILITY</h2>
          <p>
            Our stock levels are normally maintained automatically. However, if we are unable to fulfil your order immediately, we will inform you by email and provide you with a likely delivery date. Stock levels are not maintained by, or updated to our online shop, so some items not be available as advertised.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">6. VAT RATE</h2>
          <p>
            The VAT Rate now stands at 20% (as of 4th January 2011). All our prices include VAT.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">7. HIDDEN COSTS</h2>
          <p>
            There are no hidden costs at our online shop. Packaging prices and VAT are included in the item price. Shipping Rates are viewable at the 'detailed item view' and 'checkout stages' and in our shipping rates table. The current rate of VAT is set at 20%. To make our prices fair and competitive, we have not added premium rate delivery charges to our item prices and then claimed free delivery. Our shop, therefore, works out the value of your total order and will assign the correct delivery charge to that order. This amount is shown at the checkout stage.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">8. ORDERS FROM OUTSIDE MAINLAND UK</h2>
          <p>
            We have changed our shipping methods and prices in order to provide a fairer, more 'visible' and more competitive pricing system for all our customers. In order to provide the best prices, without adding premiums to each item we sell, in the name of "Free Shipping", we are now only able to provide an online ordering process to our UK mainland (including Isle of Wight) customers. Those from the Scottish Highlands and Islands, Isle of Man, Isles of Scilly, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and all international customers, are invited to submit their requests by email or telephone, where a fairer, "best deal" quote will be returned to them, along with suitable payment options.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">9. OTHER PAYMENT METHODS</h2>
          <p>
            We still accept cheques as a form of payment. If you wish to pay by cheque, please select cheque payment during the checkout process and follow the instructions. Orders will be dispatched on clearance of payment.
          </p>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary">10. PHONE ORDERS AND PAYMENTS</h2>
          <p>
            We are still happy to take orders over the phone. Please have your item codes and quantities to hand, and payment can be made by Visa or Mastercard, or by business/personal cheque. Orders will be dispatched on clearance of payment.
